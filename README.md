# LAFEAT attack

## Introduction
Because we take reproducibility very seriously,
along with the submitted paper,
we include in the supplementary materials
the source code for running the LAFEAT attack
on [TRADES](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES).
Note that for reproducibility,
the scripts are made to be completely deterministic,
your runs should *hopefully* produce
exactly the same results as ours.

## Requirements

* Python 3 (>= 3.6)
* PyTorch (>= 1.2.0)

## Instructions for reproducing attacks on TRADES

1. Download the original TRADES CIFAR-10
   [`model_cifar_wrn.pt`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10sHvaXhTNZGz618QmD5gSOAjO3rMzV33/view?usp=sharing)
   model [provided by the authors](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES#how-to-download-our-cnn-checkpoint-for-mnist-and-wrn-34-10-checkpoint-for-cifar10),
   and place it in the `models/` folder.

2. To train logits for intermediate features,
   run the following command:
   ```sh
   python3 train.py --max-epoch=100
   ```
   It will run for 100 epochs
   and save the final logits model at `models/trades.pt`.
   We have also included trained logits with the code,
   so you can skip this step.

3. To attack the TRADES model with trained intermediate logits, run:
   ```sh
   python3 attack.py --multi-targeted
   ```
   It will run a multi-targeted LAFEAT attack
   and save the adversarial images at `attacks/lafeat.pt`.

4. For testing with the original TRADES
   [evaluation script](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES/blob/master/evaluate_attack_cifar10.py),
   we need to first convert the adversarial examples
   for their script with the following command:
   ```sh
   python3 convert.py
   ```
   It converts the `.pt` file to a `.npy` file
   and performs additional range clipping
   to ensure correct L-inf boundaries
   under the effect of floating-point errors.
   It also generates a new `attacks/cifar10_X_adv.npy` file.
   For your convenience,
   we provide the file of adversarial examples
   with a **52.94%** accuracy for the CIFAR-10 test set,
   which tops the current [TRADES CIFAR-10 white-box leaderboard](https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES#white-box-leaderboard).
   Please download it from:
    * [cifar10_X_adv.npy]().

5. Download the CIFAR-10 datasets
   for TRADESâ€™s testing script:
    * [`cifar10_X.npy`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXePa721gTvmQ46bZogqNGkW31Vu6u3J/view?usp=sharing)
    * [`cifar10_Y.npy`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znICoQ8Ds9MH-1yhNssDs3hgBpvx57PV/view?usp=sharing)
   and place them in the `attacks/` folder.

6. Evaluate with the original TRADES script using:
   ```sh
   python3 eval_trades.py
   ```
